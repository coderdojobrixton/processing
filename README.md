Show the slide from Processing 4 - Rotation with Pac Man that defines has arc() rotation() and the circle on it.

At the time of writing slide 17.

Talk about :

- Global variables.  Scope is defined by where a variable a declared.
- void setup()
- You don't have give a variable a value straight away.
- void draw()

- Default values are set in setup()
- It's quite commmon to have default variables for things..

- radians() function should be used inside arc() twice.  Once for start and once for end.

- Default values are set in setup()
- The line in one half of the circle is because of the drawing mode, PIE.  Try the others to remove it.
- The line in one half of the circle is because of the drawing mode, PIE.  Try the others to remove it :
