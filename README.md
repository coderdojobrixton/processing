Show the slide from Processing 4 - Rotation with Pac Man that defines has arc() rotation() and the circle on it.
At the time of writing slide 17.

Draw a circle using Arc.

Talk about :

- void setup()
- void draw()

- Circle should be drawn in draw()

- radians() function should be used inside arc() twice.  Once for start and once for end.

- The line in one half of the circle is because of the drawing mode, PIE.  Try the others to remove it :

	OPEN
	CHORD
