#### Talk about

What is a float?
What is the difference between an int and a float?

Converting an int to a float.
Arithmatic with different types. ie if one number is a float the answer will be a float.

Use println to illustrate this.

println(float(mouseY) / height * 100.0);

Can colour be changed in the same way.
